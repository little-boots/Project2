## Research Question
We will investigate the impact of the Opioid Crisis in the United States.  Specifically:
* How has regional consumption of opioids changed from 2006 to 2012?
* Do we see a commensurate shift in the annual death rate due to opioid-related overdoses over the same time period?
* Which manufacturers were contributing most to this epidemic across the various regions of the U.S.?
* What was the per capita opioid consumption for each state from 2006 to 2012?
